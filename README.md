# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview 

The overall goal is to future-proof the Pewlett Hackard by determining how many people will be retiring and who is eligible for a retirement package. For this specific challenge, I will determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program in order to help prepare for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results

In completing the analysis I have noticed four major points:
- A total of 72,458 employees will be retiring soon.
- A large portion of retirees (72.9%) will be coming from employees who are designated as Senior Engineers or Senior Staff. This could be an issue with the continuity of projects as the possible creators and/or leaders of these efforts are retiring. Knowledge transfer sessions are fundamental. 
- Managers make up smallest percentage of retirees which could be helpful. Managers may be a useful group in facilitating the transition to new hires.
-  There is a low number of employees (1549) eligible for the mentorship program to train and mentor the next generation of employees. 


## Summary 

### How Many Roles Need to Be Filled?

There are 72,458 roles that will need to be filled. 

### Are There Enough Qualified Mentors?

There are not enough qualified, retirement ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of employees. There are only 1,549 mentorship eligible employees. They would only cover about 2% of the new hires.

### More Insights

To provide even more insight I have created two more tables:

This first table shows the number of eligible mentorship employees per title.

This second table shows the number of retiring employees per department.
